<h3>Herbal Safety Guidelines</h3>
<p>Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or
consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a
medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs
have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean
that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible

not help with administering information on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine.
This needs to be discussed with your physician.</p>
